// ## Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
// Example:
// Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

// Constraints:
// 1 <= coins.length <= 12
// 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
// 0 <= amount <= 104

class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        
    }
}
